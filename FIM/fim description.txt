The file integrity manager is a program written in PowerShell ISE that uses SHA512 hashes to check the integrity of files. It works by generating a SHA512 hash for a file and storing it in a separate file. Later, when the integrity of the file needs to be checked, the program generates a new SHA512 hash for the file and compares it to the previously stored hash. If the two hashes match, the file is considered to be intact and unaltered. If the hashes do not match, it indicates that the file has been modified, and the program alerts the user to the potential security threat. This file integrity manager provides a simple and effective way to detect any unauthorized modifications to important files on your system.
